            What is the largest planet in the Solar System?
          </h2>
          <h2 class="answer hidden">

          <h2 class="question hidden">
            What is atmospheric pressure, and how is it measured?
          </h2>
          <h2 class="answer hidden">
            Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the air on the Earth's
            surface. It is usually measured with a barometer in units of
            millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or hectopascals (hPa).

          <h2 class="question hidden">How many bones are in the human body?</h2>
          <h2 class="answer hidden">
            An adult human has 206 bones. Newborns have more (around 270), but
            as they grow, some bones fuse together.
          </h2>
          <h2 class="question hidden">Why is the sea salty?</h2>
          <h2 class="answer hidden">
            The salt in the sea comes from the continuous washing of minerals
            and salts from soil and rocks into bodies of water. Water
            evaporates, but salts remain, so over time, the water becomes
            saltier.
